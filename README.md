## Why is Android support isn't added?

- <cr>Adding android support is super duper complex compared to other devices. This involves having to tinker coco2dx jnihelper and all of those stuff that I can't be bothered to do. Plus took me 4 hours to figure it out and still can't get it to work. Even testing it intensively I still couldn't get it working :/</c>
